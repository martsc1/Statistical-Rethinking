### Easy

8E1. For each of the causal relationships below, name a hypothetical third variable that would lead
to an interaction effect.
  (1) Bread dough rises because of yeast.
  (2) Education leads to higher income.
  (3) Gasoline makes a car go.

1. Temperature
2. Gender
3. Battery

8E2. Which of the following explanations invokes an interaction?
  (1) Caramelizing onions requires cooking over low heat and making sure the onions do not
  dry out.
  (2) A car will go faster when it has more cylinders or when it has a better fuel injector.
  (3) Most people acquire their political beliefs from their parents, unless they get them instead
  from their friends.
  (4) Intelligent animal species tend to be either highly social or have manipulative appendages
  (hands, tentacles, etc.).

1,3

8E3. For each of the explanations in 8E2, write a linear model that expresses the stated relationship.

```{r}
library(dagitty)
library(rethinking)
dag1 <- dagitty( "dag{ Temperature -> Caramelization <- Dryness; Temperature -> Dryness}" )
coordinates(dag1) <- list( x=c(Temperature=0,Dryness=0,Caramelization=1) , y=c(Temperature=0,Dryness=2,Caramelization=1) )
drawdag( dag1 )

mu <- a + b_heat * heat + b_water * water + b_heat_water * heat * water

dag2 <- dagitty( "dag{ Cylinders -> Speed <- Fuelinjector}" )
coordinates(dag2) <- list( x=c(Cylinders=0,Fuelinjector=0,Speed=1) , y=c(Cylinders=0,Fuelinjector=2,Speed=1) )
drawdag( dag2 )

```


### Hard

8H1. Return to the data(tulips) example in the chapter. Now include the bed variable as a predictor
in the interaction model. Donâ€™t interact bed with the other predictors; just include it as a main
effect. Note that bed is categorical. So to use it properly, you will need to either construct dummy
variables or rather an index variable, as explained in Chapter 5.

```{r}
data(tulips)
d <- tulips

d$blooms_std <- d$blooms / max(d$blooms)
d$water_cent <- d$water - mean(d$water)
d$shade_cent <- d$shade - mean(d$shade)


H8.1 <- quap(
  alist(
    blooms_std ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
    mu <- a + b[bed] + bw*water_cent + bs*shade_cent + bws*water_cent*shade_cent ,
    a ~ dnorm( 0.5 , 0.25 ) ,
    b[bed] ~ dnorm( 0.5 , 0.25 ) ,
    bw ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.25 ) ,
    bs ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.25 ) ,
    bws ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.25 ) ,
    sigma ~ dexp( 1 )
  ) , data=d )

plot(precis(H8.1, depth=2))

```




8H2. Use WAIC to compare the model from 8H1 to a model that omits bed. What do you infer
from this comparison? Can you reconcile the WAIC results with the posterior distribution of the bed
coefficients?

```{r}
compare(m8.5, H8.1)
coeftab(m8.5, H8.1)

```
The models perform very similar in regards to their predictive accuracy

8H3. Consider again the data(rugged) data on economic development and terrain ruggedness,
examined in this chapter. One of the African countries in that example, Seychelles, is far outside
the cloud of other nations, being a rare country with both relatively high GDP and high ruggedness.
Seychelles is also unusual, in that it is a group of islands far from the coast of mainland Africa, and
its main economic activity is tourism.

  (a) Focus on model m8.5 from the chapter. Use WAIC pointwise penalties and PSIS Pareto k
  values to measure relative influence of each country. By these criteria, is Seychelles influencing the
  results? Are there other nations that are relatively influential? If so, can you explain why?
  
```{r}
data(rugged)
d <- rugged
# make log version of outcome
d$log_gdp <- log( d$rgdppc_2000 )
# extract countries with GDP data
dd <- d[ complete.cases(d$rgdppc_2000) , ]
# rescale variables
dd$log_gdp_std <- dd$log_gdp / mean(dd$log_gdp)
dd$rugged_std <- dd$rugged / max(dd$rugged)
# make variable to index Africa (1) or not (2)
dd$cid <- ifelse( dd$cont_africa==1 , 1 , 2 )

m8.3 <- quap(
  alist(
    log_gdp_std ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
    mu <- a[cid] + b[cid]*( rugged_std - 0.215 ) ,
    a[cid] ~ dnorm( 1 , 0.1 ) ,
    b[cid] ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.3 ) ,
    sigma ~ dexp( 1 )
  ) , data=dd )

set.seed(1)
PSIS_m8.3 <- PSIS(m8.3,pointwise=TRUE)
set.seed(1)
WAIC_m8.3 <- WAIC(m8.3,pointwise=TRUE)

plot( PSIS_m8.3$k , WAIC_m8.3$penalty , xlab="PSIS Pareto k" ,
ylab="WAIC penalty" , col=rangi2 , lwd=2 )
# Add country name, not in Rcode 8.17
text(PSIS_m8.3$k[PSIS_m8.3$k > 0.35] + 0.05,  
     WAIC_m8.3$penalty[PSIS_m8.3$k > 0.35], 
     labels =  as.character(dd$country[PSIS_m8.3$k > 0.35]), 
     cex = 0.5 )
mtext(side = 3, text = "Model m8.3")

max(PSIS_m8.3$k)
max(WAIC_m8.3$penalty)

```
  None of the countries has a Pareto K value above 0.5, so no warning is triggered.
  
  (b) Now use robust regression, as described in the previous chapter. Modify m8.5 to use a
  Student-t distribution with Î½ = 2. Does this change the results in a substantial way?

```{r}
m8.3t <- quap(
  alist(
    log_gdp_std ~ dstudent( 2, mu , sigma ) ,
    mu <- a[cid] + b[cid]*( rugged_std - 0.215 ) ,
    a[cid] ~ dnorm( 1 , 0.1 ) ,
    b[cid] ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.3 ) ,
    sigma ~ dexp( 1 )
  ) , data=dd )

compare(m8.3t, m8.3)
coeftab(m8.3t, m8.3)

set.seed(1)
PSIS_m8.3t <- PSIS(m8.3t,pointwise=TRUE)
set.seed(1)
WAIC_m8.3t <- WAIC(m8.3t,pointwise=TRUE)
plot( PSIS_m8.3t$k , WAIC_m8.3t$penalty , xlab="PSIS Pareto k" ,
ylab="WAIC penalty" , col=rangi2 , lwd=2 )
max(PSIS_m8.3t$k)
max(WAIC_m8.3t$penalty)

```

The student distributed model performs much worse on predictive accuracy, but has less extreme Pareto K values, and is therefore less influenced by extreme values. Since its predictive accuracy is so much lower, there probably weren't very extreme data points in the data set.


8H4.
(a) Evaluate the hypothesis that language diversity,
as measured by log(lang.per.cap), is positively associated with the average length of the growing
season, mean.growing.season. Consider log(area) in your regression(s) as a covariate (not
an interaction). Interpret your results. 

```{r}
# set up data structure
data(nettle)
d <- nettle
d$lang.per.cap <- d$num.lang / d$k.pop
d$log.lpc <- log(d$lang.per.cap)
d$zgrow_season <- (d$mean.growing.season - mean(d$mean.growing.season))/sd(d$mean.growing.season)
d$log_area <- log(d$area)   
d$zlogarea <- (d$log_area - mean(d$log_area))/sd(d$log_area) 

# define model
H8.4a <- quap(
  alist(
    log.lpc ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
    mu <- a + ba*zlogarea + bzgs*zgrow_season,
    a ~ dnorm( 0 , 1 ) ,
    ba ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.25 ) ,
    bzgs ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.25 ) ,
    sigma ~ dexp( 1 )
  ) , data=d )

# check priors
set.seed(1) 
prior <- extract.prior( H8.4a )
# set up the plot dimensions
plot( NULL , xlim=c(0,1) , ylim=c(0,2) ,
xlab="mean.growing.season" , ylab="log LPC" )
abline( h=min(d$log.lpc) , lty=2 )
abline( h=max(d$log.lpc) , lty=2 )
# draw 50 lines from the prior
mgs_seq <- seq( from=-0.1 , to=1.1 , length.out=30 )
mu <- link( H8.4a , post=prior , data=data.frame(zgrow_season=mgs_seq, zlogarea = 0.5) )
for ( i in 1:50 ) lines( mgs_seq , mu[i,] , col=col.alpha("black",0.3) )

precis(H8.4a)

# Plot
plot(d$zgrow_season, d$log.lpc, xlab = "Mean growing season (z-score)",
     ylab = "Log proportional language diversity", xlim = c(-2.5, 2.5))

# Add line for zsd_grow_season = zsd
mu <- link(H8.4a, n = 1e4, data = list(zgrow_season = seq(-3, 3, 0.1), 
                           zlogarea = mean(d$zlogarea)))
lines(seq(-3, 3, 0.1), apply(mu, 2, mean), lty = 2, col = "black")
shade(apply(mu, 2, HPDI, prob = 0.95), seq(-3, 3, 0.1))
```
Mean growing season seems to be positively associated with language diversity, also when controlling for area

(b) Now evaluate the hypothesis that language diversity is
negatively associated with the standard deviation of length of growing season, sd.growing.season.
This hypothesis follows from uncertainty in harvest favoring social insurance through larger social
networks and therefore fewer languages. Again, consider log(area) as a covariate (not an interaction).
Interpret your results. 

```{r}
d$zsdGS <- (d$sd.growing.season - mean(d$sd.growing.season))/sd(d$sd.growing.season)

# define model
H8.4b <- quap(
  alist(
    log.lpc ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
    mu <- a + ba*zlogarea + bzsdGS*zsdGS,
    a ~ dnorm( 0 , 1 ) ,
    ba ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.25 ) ,
    bzsdGS ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.25 ) ,
    sigma ~ dexp( 1 )
  ) , data=d )


precis(H8.4b)

# Plot
plot(d$zsdGS, d$log.lpc, xlab = "SD growing season (z-score)",
     ylab = "Log proportional language diversity", xlim = c(-2.5, 2.5))

# Add line for zsd_grow_season = zsd
mu <- link(H8.4b, n = 1e4, data = list(zsdGS = seq(-3, 3, 0.1), 
                           zlogarea = mean(d$zlogarea)))
lines(seq(-3, 3, 0.1), apply(mu, 2, mean), lty = 2, col = "black")
shade(apply(mu, 2, HPDI, prob = 0.95), seq(-3, 3, 0.1))
```
SD growing season seems to be negatively associated with language diversity, also when controlling for area

(c) Finally, evaluate the hypothesis that mean.growing.season and
sd.growing.season interact to synergistically reduce language diversity. The idea is that, in nations
with longer average growing seasons, high variance makes storage and redistribution even more important
than it would be otherwise. That way, people can cooperate to preserve and protect windfalls
to be used during the droughts.

8H5. Consider the data(Wines2012) data table. These data are expert ratings of 20 different French
and American wines by 9 different French and American judges. Your goal is to model score, the
subjective rating assigned by each judge to each wine. I recommend standardizing it. In this problem,
consider only variation among judges and wines. Construct index variables of judge and wine and
then use these index variables to construct a linear regression model. Justify your priors. You should
end up with 9 judge parameters and 20 wine parameters. 


```{r}

data(Wines2012)
d <- Wines2012

d$std_score <- (d$score-mean(d$score))/sd(d$score)
d$iJudge <- as.integer(d$judge)

  alist(
    std_score ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
    mu <- a[iJudge] + b[iWine] ,

# Compare coefficients a above with mean value for judges:

# Compare coefficients a above with mean value for wine:

range(judges$meanscore)
range(wines$meanscore)
```

- How do you interpret the variation among individual judges and individual wines? 
There is about equal variation in the meanscore based on the judges, and based on the wines

- Do you notice any patterns, just by plotting the differences?
There seems to be more agreement about a very bad wine than a very good wine

- Which judges gave the highest/lowest ratings? 
Judges 5 & 6 gave the highest ratings, judges 8 & 4 gave the lowest ratings.

- Which wines were rated worst/best on average?
Wines 4 & 20 got the highest ratings, wines 18 & 6 got the lowest ratings.



8H6. Now consider three features of the wines and judges:
  (1) flight: Whether the wine is red or white.
  (2) wine.amer: Indicator variable for American wines.
  (3) judge.amer: Indicator variable for American judges.
Use indicator or index variables to model the influence of these features on the scores. Omit the
individual judge and wine index variables from Problem 1. Do not include interaction effects yet.
Again justify your priors.
- What do you conclude about the differences among the wines and judges?
Try to relate the results to the inferences in the previous problem.

```{r}
d$iFlight <- as.integer(d$flight)
d$iWA <- d$wine.amer+1 
d$iJA <- d$judge.amer+1 

H8.6 <- quap(
  alist(
    std_score ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
    mu <- a[iFlight] + b[iWA] + c[iJA],
    a[iFlight] ~ dnorm( 0 , 1 ) ,
    b[iJA] ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.5 ) ,
    c[iWA] ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.5 ) ,
    sigma ~ dexp( 1 )
  ) , data=d )

precis(H8.6, depth = 2, prob = 0.95)
```

No difference between red & white wines.
American wines slightly worse ratings than french.
American judges gave slightly higher ratings than french judges.
There is a lot of uncertainty though with large variations.


8H7. Now consider two-way interactions among the three features. You should end up with three
different interaction terms in your model. These will be easier to build, if you use indicator variables.
Again justify your priors. Explain what each interaction means. Be sure to interpret the modelâ€™s
predictions on the outcome scale (mu, the expected score), not on the scale of individual parameters.
You can use link to help with this, or just use your knowledge of the linear model instead. What do
you conclude about the features and the scores? Can you relate the results of your model(s) to the
individual judge and wine inferences from 8H5?

```{r}
d$wine.white <- d$iFlight -1

H8.7 <- quap(
  alist(
    std_score ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
    mu <- a + b1*wine.white + b2*wine.amer + b3*judge.amer +
      b4*wine.white*wine.amer + b5*wine.amer*judge.amer + b6*wine.white*judge.amer,
    c(a,b1,b2,b3,b4,b5,b6) ~ dnorm(0,1) ,
    sigma ~ dexp( 1 )
  ) , data=d )

precis(H8.7, depth = 2, prob = 0.95)


```
It seems like white wines are generally rated lower than red wines (b1)
American wines are generally rated lower than french ones (b2)
American judges generally rate wines higher than french judges (b3)
White wines are rated more highly if they are american
And there are no strong interactions between american wines and american judges (b5), 
nor between white wines and american judges (b6)

```{r}
set.seed(123)

quadtych <- function(judge = 0, white = 0) {
  plot(d$wine.amer, d$std_score, xlab = "American wine",
     ylab = "Wine score (Z)", xlim = c(0, 1))

    mu <- link(H8.7, n = 1e4, data = list(wine.amer = c(0,1), 
                           judge.amer = judge, wine.white = white))
  lines(c(0,1), apply(mu, 2, mean), lty = 2, col = "black")
  shade(apply(mu, 2, HPDI, prob = 0.95), c(0,1))
  mtext(side = 3, text = sprintf("Judge is American = %0.f, Wine is white = %0.f",judge, white), cex = 0.7)
}

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
quadtych(judge = 0, white = 0)
quadtych(judge = 1, white = 0)
quadtych(judge = 0, white = 1)
quadtych(judge = 1, white = 1)



```
Judges 5 & 6 gave the highest ratings, judges 8 & 4 gave the lowest ratings.
Wines 4 & 20 got the highest ratings, wines 18 & 6 got the lowest ratings.

High raters
Judge 5: American
Judge 6: American
Low raters
Judge 8: American
Judge 4: French

Good wine
Wine 4: Red & French
Wine 20: Red & French
Bad wine
Wine 18: Red & American
Wine 6: Red & American

Red wines fall more on both sides of the extreme, but the French fall more on the positive, and the American more on the negative.
So the French tend to make better red wines, but there is no big difference between the quality in white wines.
